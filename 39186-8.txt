CHARTA S. PATRICII.

---

In nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi. Ego Patricius humilis
servunculus Dei, anno incarnationis ejusdem quadringentesimo vigesimo
quinto, in Hiberniam a sanctissimo papa Coelestino legatus, Dei gratia
Hibernicos ad viam veritatis converti. Et cum eos in fide catholica
solidassem, tandem in Britanniam sum reversus, ac, ut credo, duce Deo,
_qui vita est et via_ (_Joan._ XIV, 6), incidi in insulam _Ynswytryn_,
in qua inveni locum sanctum ac vetustum, a Deo electum et
sanctificatum, in honore intemeratæ Virginis Dei genitricis Marias.
Ibique reperi quosdam fratres rudimentis catholicæ fidei imbutos, et
piæ conversationis, qui successerunt discipulis sanctorum Phagani et
Diruviani, quorum nomina, pro vitæ meritis, veraciter credo scripta in
coelis (_Philip_. IV, 3). Et quia in memoria æterna erunt justi
(_Psal_. CXI, 7), cum eosdem fratres tenere dilexissem, eorum nomina
scripto meo redigere volui, quæ sunt: Brumban, Hyregaan, Bremwal,
Wencreth, Bantommeweng, Adelwolred, Loyor, Wellias, Breden, Swelwes,
Hinloernus, et alius Hyn. Hi cum essent nobilibus orti natalibus,
nobilitatem suam fidei operibus ornare cupientes, eremiticam vitam
ducere elegerunt. Et quoniam inveni eos humiles ac quietos, elegi
potius cum illis abjectus esse, magis quam in regalibus curiis
habitare (_Psal_. LXXXIII, 11). Sed quia omnium nostrum _erat cor unum
et anima una_ (_Act_. IV, 32), elegimus omnes simul habitare, comedere
et bibere pariter, et in eadem domo dormire. Sicque me licet invitum
sibi prætulerunt. _Non enim dignus eram solvere corrigiam
calceamentorum_ (_Marc_. I, 7) eorum.

Et cum vitam monasticam ita duceremus juxta normam probabilium Patrum,
ostenderunt mihi præfati fratres scripta sanctorum Phagani et
Diruviani, in quibus continebatur, quod duodecim discipuli sanctorum
Philippi et Jacobi, ipsam vetustam ecclesiam construxerunt in honore
prælibatæ Advocatricis nostræ, per doctrinamentum beati archangeli
Gabrielis. Insuper et quod Dominus eamdem ecclesiam coelitus in honore
suæ Matris dedicaverat, et quod tres reges pagani, ipsis duodecim ad
eorum sustenementum duodecim portiones terræ dederunt; nec non et in
scriptis recentioribus inveni, quod sancti Phaganus et Diruvianus
perquisierant ab Eleutherio papa, qui eos miserat, triginta annos
indulgentiæ. Et ego frater Patricius a piæ memoriæ Coelestino papa
duodecim annos tempore meo acquisivi.

Post multum vero temporis, assumpto mecum Wellia confratre meo, per
condensitatem silvæ cum magna difficultate conscendimus cacumen montis
qui eminet in eadem insula. Quo cum pervenissemus, apparuit oratorium
unum vetustum et fere dirutum, habile tamen devotioni Christianæ, et
(prout mihi videbatur) a Deo electum. Quod cum ingressi essemus, tanta
odoris suavitate replebamur, ut in paradisi amoenitate positos nos
crederemus. Egredientes igitur et reingredientes, locumque diligentius
perscrutantes, invenimus volumen unum in quo scripti erant Actus
apostolorum, pariter cum actis et gestis sanctorum Phagani et
Diruviani, ex magna parte consumptum; in cujus tamen fine voluminis
invenimus scripturam quæ dicebat quod prædicti Phaganus et Diruvianus,
per revelationem Domini nostri Jesu Christi idem oratorium
ædificaverunt in honore sancti Michaelis archangeli, quatenus ibi ab
hominibus haberet honorem, qui homines in perpetuos honores, jubente
Deo, est introducturus. At cum delectaret nos illa scriptura,
nitebamur eam ad finem legere. Dicebat enim eadem scriptura quod
venerandi Phaganus et Diruvianus moram ibi fecerunt per novem annos,
et quod ipsi etiam perquisierant triginta annorum indulgentiam omnibus
Christicolis locum ipsum ad honorem beati Michaelis pia voluntate
visitantibus. Invento ergo tanto divinæ bonitatis thesauro, ego et
frater Wellias tribus mensibus jejunavimus, orationibus vacantes et
vigiliis, dæmonibusque et belluis multiformiter apparentibus
imperantes. Quadam autem nocte cum me sopori dedissem, apparuit mihi
Dominus Jesus in visa dicens: Patrici serve meus, scias me elegisse
locum istum ad honorem nominis mei, et ut hic honoranter invocent
adjutorium archangeli mei Michaelis. Et hoc tibi signum et fratribus
tuis, quatenus et ipsi credant: brachium tuum sinistrum arescet, donec
quæ vidisti annuntiaveris fratribus qui in cella sunt inferiori, et
denuo hic redieris. Et factum est ita.

Ab illo die statuimus duos fratres in perpetuum ibi, nisi pastores
futuri ob justam causam aliter decreverint. Arnulpho autem et Ogmar
Hibernicis fratribus qui mecum venerant de Hibernia, pro eo quod ad
exhortationem meam apud dictum humiliter oratorium manere coeperunt,
præsentem paginam commisi, aliam similem in arca sanctæ Mariæ
retinens, in monumentum posteris. Et ego frater Patricius per
consilium fratrum meorum, omnibus qui silvam ex omni parte præfati
montis (_Psal_. LXXIII, 6) in securi et ascia, pia intentione
dejecerint, ut facilior paretur aditus Christianis, ecclesiam beatæ
perpetuæque Virginis pie visitantibus, centum dies veniæ concedo.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
